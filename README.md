## 💻 4. Software Requirements

### 🧠 A.D.A. — Local AI

The existing A.D.A. project is the intended starting point.

Planned tasks:
1. Confirm the project files are available.
2. Set up the supported Python environment.
3. Install the required dependencies.

5. Verify that the selected local model responds.
6. Launch the simplest supported A.D.A. interface.
7. Test basic questions and local document workflows.
8. Improve error handling and document the limitations.

A local AI model can produce incorrect answers. Important information should be checked against the underlying reference material.

### 📚 Offline knowledge

Planned tools include:
- Kiwix with suitable downloaded ZIM archives
- A local PDF reader
- A searchable folder of reference documents
- Downloaded technical manuals
- A record of source, date, size, and license for each dataset

### 🗺️ Maps and GPS

Planned tasks:
1. Select an offline mapping application.
2. Test it with downloaded map data.
3. Confirm it works with the network disconnected.
4. Add a compatible GPS receiver later.
5. Test location reporting and offline route planning.

### 📻 Radio

Planned tasks:
1. Decide whether FM reception alone is sufficient.
2. Select a compatible receiver module.
3. Verify driver and software support.
4. Plan antenna placement.
5. Test reception and controls once hardware is available.

### 🖥️ Dashboard

The dashboard will provide access to:
- A.D.A.
- Offline knowledge
- Maps
- Radio controls
- Storage status
- System information

The dashboard can be prototyped on the existing computer before the physical cyberdeck is assembled.

## 📐 5. CAD Design Plan

The initial concept uses a provisional enclosure of **360 × 280 mm** with a larger screen opening.

The current screen opening concept is **270 × 170 mm**. This is a target opening size, not a confirmed display model.

### CAD components

- [ ] Main enclosure base
- [ ] Lid and display opening
- [ ] Display mounting points
- [ ] Keyboard mounting area
- [ ] Internal mounting plate
- [ ] Computer mounting points
- [ ] Storage-drive cradles
- [ ] Cooling openings
- [ ] Port and cable openings
- [ ] Hinge and latch clearances
- [ ] Service access and fasteners

### CAD validation

1. Choose candidate components.
2. Obtain their real dimensions from manufacturer drawings.
3. Update the CAD to match those dimensions.
4. Check component collisions and cable clearances.
5. Check the lid closes without contacting the keyboard or electronics.
6. Verify cooling openings and service access.
7. Assemble all components into one CAD assembly.
8. Export a `.STEP` file.
9. Save screenshots of the complete model.

**Important:** the current CAD package is a preliminary concept. It is not yet a verified, complete manufacturing assembly.

3. Create a matching schematic.
4. Validate all footprints against datasheets.
5. Check signal and resistor connections.
6. Route copper.
7. Add mounting holes and board clearances.
8. Run electrical and PCB design-rule checks.
9. Request a design review.
10. Export manufacturing files only after verification.

### PCB B — Power distribution

Planned function: distribute power to the computer and peripherals.

This board must be designed around the selected components' voltage, current, connector, and protection requirements. It is not designed or validated yet.

### PCB C — Radio/GPS interface

Planned function: provide connectors and interface support for selected radio and GPS modules.

The exact circuit depends on the receiver hardware chosen later.
